# my-context

> Track what you're working on, not just what you've done.

A cross-platform CLI tool for managing developer work contexts with notes, file associations, and timestamps. Built in Go, designed for the Unix philosophy.

## What it does

my-context creates lightweight, timestamped work journals that track your development activities across sessions. Unlike git stash (files only) or note apps (manual), my-context automatically manages context transitions while capturing decisions, associated files, and timestamps in plain text.

## Core capabilities

- **Context tracking**: Start/stop named work sessions with automatic transitions
- **Timestamped notes**: Capture decisions and progress as you work
- **File associations**: Link source files to contexts for later reference
- **Project grouping**: Organize contexts by project with filters and search
- **Export**: Generate markdown summaries for documentation or sharing
- **Plain text storage**: All data stored as human-readable files in ~/.my-context/

## Quick start

```bash
# Install
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaldwell-labs/my-context/main/scripts/curl-install.sh | bash

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/jcaldwell-labs/my-context.git && cd my-context
go build -o my-context ./cmd/my-context/
```

## Common commands

```bash
# Start a work context
my-context start "Feature: user authentication"

# Add notes as you work
my-context note "Chose JWT over sessions for stateless auth"
my-context note "Added refresh token rotation"

# Associate relevant files
my-context file src/auth/jwt.go

# Switch contexts (previous auto-stops)
my-context start "Hotfix: login timeout"

# View current context
my-context show

# List recent contexts
my-context list --limit 5

# Export context to markdown
my-context export "Feature: user authentication"
```

## Command reference

| Command | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `start <name>` | `s` | Create and activate a new context |
| `stop` | `p` | Stop the active context |
| `note <text>` | `n` | Add timestamped note |
| `file <path>` | `f` | Associate file with context |
| `show` | `w` | Display current context |
| `list` | `l` | List contexts (supports --project, --search, --limit) |
| `history` | `h` | Show transition history |
| `export <name>` | `e` | Export to markdown/JSON |
| `archive <name>` | `a` | Archive completed context |
| `delete <name>` | `d` | Permanently remove context |

## Use cases

1. **Daily development workflow** — Track what you worked on each day with automatic timestamps
2. **Context switching** — Seamlessly switch between tasks while preserving state
3. **Decision documentation** — Capture why choices were made as you code
4. **Sprint reviews** — Export contexts to markdown for retrospectives
5. **AI-assisted coding** — Provide session memory for coding agents

## Architecture

```
~/.my-context/
├── state.json              # Active context pointer
├── transitions.log         # Transition history
└── Context_Name/           # Per-context directory
    ├── meta.json           # Context metadata
    ├── notes.log           # Timestamped notes
    ├── files.log           # File associations
    └── touch.log           # Activity timestamps
```

- **Language**: Go 1.24+
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (cobra for CLI)
- **Storage**: Plain text (JSON + log files)
- **Platforms**: Windows, Linux, macOS, WSL

## Related jcaldwell-labs Projects

my-context is part of the jcaldwell-labs organization. These sister projects share design philosophy and offer integration opportunities:

### Terminal/TUI Applications
- **my-grid** — ASCII canvas editor with vim-style navigation, zones, PTY support
- **boxes-live** — Real-time ASCII box drawing with joystick support
- **terminal-stars** — Starfield animation for terminals
- **atari-style** — Retro visual effects and shaders for terminal apps
- **smartterm-prototype** — Smart terminal with readline-like features

### CLI Tools
- **fintrack** — Personal finance tracking CLI (Go)
- **tario** — Terminal-based platformer game (Go)

### Game Engines & Meta
- **adventure-engine-v2** — Multiplayer text adventure engine (C)
- **capability-catalog** — Skill/capability definitions for AI agents

### Cross-Project Synergies

**my-context + capability-catalog**: my-context provides session memory that AI agents defined in capability-catalog can use to maintain context across coding sessions.

**my-context + smartterm-prototype**: smartterm's readline-like features can integrate my-context commands for seamless context switching within terminal workflows.

**atari-style + terminal-stars**: atari-style shaders can enhance terminal-stars visuals with CRT effects, scanlines, and color cycling.

**my-grid + boxes-live**: my-grid's zone system can incorporate boxes-live's real-time drawing for interactive ASCII prototyping sessions.

**fintrack + my-context**: Both share Go CLI architecture patterns (Cobra, plain-text storage) and could use unified context tracking for finance-related development work.
