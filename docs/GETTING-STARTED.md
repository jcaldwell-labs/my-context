## Key Concepts (Brief Intro)

### Context
A **context** is a work session. When you start working on something, you create a context. When you're done, you stop it.

```bash
my-context start "Your work here"
# ... work ...
my-context stop
```

### Notes
You take **notes** throughout the work to record decisions.

```bash
my-context note "Chose database X because..."
my-context note "Performance improvement: 10x faster"
```

### Files
You track which **files** you modified.

```bash
my-context file path/to/file.go
```

### Project
Contexts can be tagged with a **project** for organization.

```bash
my-context start "Task" --project myproject
```

### Archive
When contexts are done, you **archive** them to keep your list clean.

```bash
my-context archive "Old context"
```

### Signals & Watches (Advanced)
**Signals** are event notifications. **Watches** monitor contexts and react.

```bash
my-context signal create "work-complete"
my-context watch --new-notes --pattern="done"
```
